          <div class="no-account-text thin middle">MyMonero is a service providing free hosted Monero accounts. It was developed with the assistance of the Monero Core Team, and is managed by Riccardo "fluffypony" Spagni, a member of the Monero Core Team. It was started through seed funding provided by Risto Pietila along with operational funding provided by Riccardo Spagni, who collectively own MyMonero. Large portions of the code were developed with the assistance and hard work of Lucas Jones and Matthew Little.</div>

          <div class="info-header middle">What is a Hosted Monero Account?</div>
          <div class="no-account-text thin middle">MyMonero provides secure, hosted Monero accounts in order to provide easy access to funds for those that would prefer not to run a full Monero client themselves, or for those on devices with limited resources. You can access your account on any device, as long as you have access to your private login key. MyMonero never knows your private login key, and is thus unable to spend your funds without your authorisation. All of the private cryptography is done locally on your device.</div>
